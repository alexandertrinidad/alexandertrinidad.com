## Abstract
This study examines women’s perceptions of safety in a high-risk area undergoing urban
redesign. Using a mixed-method approach - systematic observation, surveys, and Safety Walks
before and after the intervention - it explores how the built environment influences feelings of
insecurity. Grounded in Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED), the
research integrates quantitative and qualitative data to provide a comprehensive understanding of safety. It highlights the often-overlooked issue of women’s safety in public spaces and offers insights to guide urban planners and policymakers in creating inclusive, safety-focused design strategies that enhance well-being in public environments.
