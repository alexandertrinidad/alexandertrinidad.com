## Editorial Board
I serve as Associate Editor for the [*Campbell Systematic Reviews* (Crime and Justice Group)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/18911803/homepage/editorial-board) and the [*International E-Journal of Criminal Sciences*](https://ojs.ehu.eus/index.php/inecs/about/editorialTeam). I am also a member of the editorial board of [*Evidence Base: Criminal Justice Research, Policy & Action*](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/rebj20/about-this-journal#editorial-board) (recently established).

## Open Science

During my postdoctoral stage at the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcements (NSCR), and partly at the University of Cologne, I was part of the [*NSC-R Workshop coordination Team*](https://nscrweb.netlify.app/)—an online workshop series intended to support researchers in building R programming skills while encouraging the adoption of open science principles. 

In 2024, together with [Dr Christof Nägel](https://christofnaegel.netlify.app/), I co-organised the two days in-person workshop on [Open Science and Open Data in European Criminological Research](https://iss-wiso.uni-koeln.de/sites/soziologie/user_upload/Call_for_Papers_Crim_ECONtr_ENOC_UzK.pdf) at the University of Cologne.
