    "text": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we ask whether broader societal changes in Germany over the last three decades have been accompanied by a secular rise or decline in public concerns about crime. We conceptualize the aggregate effect of these changes as a period effect to be identified in a framework of age-period-cohort (APC) analysis. Upon evaluation of previous research, we argue that the secular trend is challenging to identify directly both for empirical and theoretical reasons. However, using Fosse and Winship’s bounding approach to APC analysis, we show that the challenge can be resolved indirectly, and identify a declining period trend under an intuitive and theoretically warranted assumption that crime concerns are unlikely to decrease from late adolescence into adulthood."

This study explores police-recorded thefts against urban tourists in the city of Barcelona (Spain). We apply Conjunctive Analysis of Case Configurations to a large data sample to uncover victimization case profiles and the context in which crimes are committed. Comparisons to resident victimization reveal that the case profiles most likely to result in a tourist being the victim of theft have predominantly female, young targets, and occur mostly at restaurants/bars and during the Summer. Future research should examine victimization trends while accounting for time spent in different settings, and compare self-protective behaviors taken by tourists and residents."

    "text": "Abstract\nAlthough evidence regarding the journey-to-crime in juvenile offenders is available for some areas of the world, little is known about their mobility patterns in Southern Europe. Variables such as prosocial facilities, transport stations, or socioeconomic backdrop have been proved to influence the traveled distance. Therefore, we aimed to confirm previous findings in the journey-to-crime literature using data provided by the Juvenile Justice Department of the Basque Country (Spain). Although some results are in line with those of previous studies, emphasizing the relevance of environmental factors for better understanding crime patterns in the juvenile population, other specific patterns also emerged that suggest the need to replicate research across countries and to consider specific behavior patterns and styles of spatial design in each study setting."

Assisted by ASReview, 36,052 papers from six databases were screened, followed by full-text reviews by two independent reviewers. Only studies using validated diagnostic instruments to assess PTSD in random samples of general prison or jail populations in the US between 1980 and 2023 were included. Of the initial 221 studies selected for an in-depth full-text screening, ten studies, with a combined sample size of 4,016 participants, met the inclusion criteria—four more than the original review. Meta-analyses were conducted to estimate pooled prevalence rates and evaluate heterogeneity and bias. The point prevalence of PTSD was 16% for men and 32% for women, while lifetime prevalence was 38% for men and 45% for women. Despite restricting the analysis to one country and applying stringent inclusion criteria, high between-study heterogeneity persists, indicating the need for caution in interpreting and generalizing the results."

Considering the opportunity perspective, the current study aims to better understand the influence that situational and contextual factors have on juvenile (12–18 years old) delinquency in a southern European region. Police data from the municipalities of the Basque Country (located at the north of Spain) was analysed using a negative binomial regression, showing that opportunity related variables, such as non-risky leisure and population size, have significant positive effects on juvenile delinquency, whereas risky leisure opportunities, single-parent families or residential instability are not related to juvenile delinquency, suggesting that some predictors well established in the literature could not work as expected in certain cultural and geographic contexts."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper aims to summarise and integrate the accumulated knowledge on recent literature analysing the situational factors of juvenile delinquency and draw future avenues for research. A review of recent empirical papers published on two relevant databases allowed us to gather a sample of 88 papers published from 2010 to 2017 that analyse the role of situational factors of delinquent behaviour using quantitative methods and applying one of the situational theories. The results highlight the robustness of some situational and environmental variables for a deeper understanding of juvenile antisocial behaviour by putting it into context. There is a considerable amount of evidence to corroborate the impact of unstructured leisure activities on antisocial behaviour, or the role of home location in establishing a geographic area of action. However, there is ambiguous evidence on other aspects: i.e. guardianship needs to be understood and measure in a more complex way, and the role of physical design of the places where juvenile delinquency happens deserves further analysis. Future research lines from this perspective are needed and will offer relevant improvements for better understanding juvenile delinquency and designing more effective preventive measures."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nBackground/aim: In child sexual abuse (CSA) cases, the forensic evaluation of psychological harm is crucial for substantiating victim testimony and informing compensation awards. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is the primary diagnosis for assessing forensic harm, as it establishes the causal link between the harm and the CSA event. Thus, a meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the effect of CSA victimization on PTSD development and the probability of resulting psychological harm, and to determine the incremental harm attributable to CSA victimization. Method: A total of 126 primary studies were selected, yielding 195 effect sizes and a cumulative sample of 29,517 victims. Random effects psychometric meta-analyses were performed, correcting effect sizes for sampling error and criterion unreliability to obtain the true effect size (δ). Results: An overall large true effect size (δ = 0.93) was found between CSA victimization and PTSD outcomes. Given the heterogeneity of the studies, moderating variables were examined, revealing that female victims (δ = 0.99), intrafamilial abuse (δ = 1.68) and penetrative acts (δ = 1.23) were associated with significantly higher psychological harm attributable to CSA victimization than males (δ = 0.68), extrafamilial abuse (δ = 1.24) and non-penetrative sexual touching (δ = 1.01), respectively. The prevalence of PTSD diagnosis in CSA survivors was estimated at 33.95%. The incremental harm due to CSA victimization was estimated at 42.2% in general, with specific higher rates for intrafamilial abuse (64.3%) and for victims of penetration (54.4%). Conclusions: These findings provide robust evidence of the psychological harm (PTSD) resulting from CSA victimization and identify specific abuse characteristics that exacerbate such a harm. The judicial implications for the burden of proof are discussed and gold standards for civil compensation to victims are suggested as follows: a general gold standard of 42.2% for victims of CSA, and higher gold standards for victims of intrafamilial abuse (64.3%) and victims of penetration (54.4%)."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe present study aims to explore the negative online experiences in adolescence, as well as examine the associations of those and their interaction patterns with the frequency of worry and risk perception in relation to several types of online victimization. We conducted a cross-sectional survey study conducted between 2022 and 2023. We collected a nonprobabilistic sample of 824 Spanish adolescents. We elaborated a questionnaire based on measures of online victimization to collect data about the fear of and risk perception of online victimization. The sample was composed of 48.3% females, 49.5% males, and 1.8% gender nonbinary, aged between 12 and 18 years old (mean = 14.53, standard deviation = 1.48). The results showed a prevalence point of negative experiences in the use of social networking or messaging apps of 23.4%, with older adolescents (aged 15–18 years) having a slightly higher prevalence than younger adolescents. Additionally, negative online experience was higher among female adolescents. The bivariate analyses of the high frequency of worry about and risk perception of online victimization and gender revealed that, overall, adolescents are more worried about online victimization than they perceive risk. The log-linear regression shows different types of associations among, the high frequency of worry about or risk perception of online victimization, negative online experiences, and gender."

    "text": "Abstract\nResearch on youth delinquency has been essential for gaining a deeper understanding of the etiology of delinquent behavior. Studies considering the environmental perspective have increased during the last decade, but relatively little attention has been paid to temporal patterns and weather conditions. The present study explores the seasonality of youth delinquency as well as the association between violent and non-violent youth offenses and temperature, rainfall, level of darkness, type of day, type of place, and companionship, using data gathered by the police along with data obtained from official weather agencies. To this end, we conducted ANOVA and contingency table analyses. Seasonality was found for non-violent crimes. Companionship, semi-public, and public places were all associated with a higher likelihood of non-violent crime, while darkness and public holidays raise the odds of violent crime to happen. No direct association was found between temperature and type of crime."

This study examines differences in safety perceptions across two environments and analyzes variables influencing active transportation decisions (walking or cycling) within these contexts. Using surveys and systematic observation in neighborhoods of differing socio-economic levels, we also explore the relationship between built environment design, walkability, and safety. Residents in disadvantaged neighborhoods reported higher unsafety levels and greater disruption in mobility dynamics, with safety concerns playing a more prominent role in their decisions. These findings help clarify inconsistencies in literature regarding perceived unsafety and active mobility."

    "text": "Abstract\nThroughout the three last decades the study of the special and contextual variables associated with the delinquency has increased. The empirical evidence has signaled that the crimes are concentrated in specific spaces in the city and around certain type of facilities and services. Nevertheless, the studies in the south of Europe about this issue are certainly scarce, especially if it is about centering the analysis in juvenile population. The main objective is to explore the concentration of the juvenile delinquency in urban space and to study the types of predominant facilities in the resultant hotspots. For it, and under the theoretical framework that the situational perspectives could bring to, the offences committed by minors with data provided by the Basque country police (Spain) were analyzed - following a retrospective ex post facto methodology. Clusters of geolocated events have been obtained and, through an analysis of the areas of influence, a recount of the facilities that exist around those clusters has been done. The results indicate that concentration of the infringements exists in specific places in which certain facilities prevail over others."

El desconocimiento de las cifras oficiales sobre la delincuencia juvenil propicia que se perfilen características de menores infractores que no se corresponden con la realidad. Por ello, presentamos una revisión de las estadísticas sobre las infracciones juveniles en la Comunidad Autónoma del País Vasco durante el periodo del 2007-2012 en base al Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE), comparándolas a nivel nacional. Teniendo en cuenta anteriores evaluaciones de la justicia juvenil en la CAPV realizadas por el Instituto Vasco de Criminología, se ha querido hacer un análisis descriptivo mediante frecuencias de los datos obtenidos. De esta manera, tras la revisión de diferentes variables como el número de infracciones cometidas, el sexo y el lugar de nacimiento, y su comparación a nivel nacional con la CAPV, se han obtenido algunas conclusiones acerca del menor infractor en la Comunidad Autónoma del País Vasco."
