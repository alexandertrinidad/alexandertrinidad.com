## Acknowledgments & Code Inspirations

Much of the syntax used for my website has been inspired by or adapted from these sources, and I really appreciate the authors for sharing their code.
```{r sources, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, resize.height='asis'}
library(knitr)

kable(data.frame("Source" = c("[Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com/)", 
                   "[John Paul Helveston](https://www.jhelvy.com/)",
                   "[Affective Communication & Computing Lab](https://affcom.ku.edu/)"),
                 "Syntax" = c("[GitHub](https://github.com/andrewheiss/ath-quarto)",
                              "[GitHub](https://github.com/jhelvy/jhelvy_quarto)",
